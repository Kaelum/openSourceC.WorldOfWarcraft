# openSourceC.WorldOfWarcraft

### 04/27/2013 - [Release v2.2b](https://www.github.com/Kaelum/openSourceC.WorldOfWarcraft/releases/view/104666) is ready for download!
Please read the release notes as the library interface has changed.  Example code is available on the [Documentation](http://oscworldofwarcraft.codeplex.com/documentation) page.

#### Project Description
This is a client library for the World of Warcraft Community Platform API. It is a bare bones expandable approach that contains everything that is needed to access the API in a simple manor. It supports the entire Community Platform API and will be updated as Blizzard adds, changes, and removes features.

When Blizzard relocates or removes server hosts, or changes method paths, you don't need to recompile and redeploy the application. All of these settings are in the conifiguration file. Simply make the required changes to the configuration file and restart the application.

I created this site back in 2006 when I was primarily working with Community Server on the side.  I currently no longer support Community Server, but I do have some open source projects that I have been meaning to make available.  Here is a list of some of the projects that I have been working on:  
  
* ~~**[openSourceC.Daylife](http://oscdaylife.codeplex.com/)**~~
  * ~~A client API library that allows full .NET access to the entire [Daylife API](http://developer.daylife.com/).~~
* ~~**[openSourceC.Factiva](http://oscfactiva.codeplex.com/)**~~
  * ~~A client API library that allows full .NET access to the Factiva Select service.~~
* **[openSourceC.FrameworkLibrary](https://www.github.com/Kaelum/openSourceC.FrameworkLibrary/)**
  * A C#.NET 4.0 Framework Library that I have been working on for the past 9 years.
  * The library has evolved over time, starting out as miscellaneous C/C++ and VB6 code snippets from the mid to late 90's.
* ~~**[openSourceC.NewsCred](http://oscnewscred.codeplex.com/)**~~
  * ~~A client API library that allows full .NET access to the NewsCred API.~~
